<!-- #backlog:600 write community section -->

IIIF is pushed forward by [technical specification and community groups][groups]. Technical specification groups are responsible for developing new IIIF specifications. Community groups are less formal and can bring together practitioners in a certain domain.

On the community calls you can share updates and demos with the community. Notes are taken during meetings.

<!-- #backlog:30 add a section here on promoting IIIF. Maybe an exercise where folks work on their elevator pitches? -->
