## Exercise

Read about the various named features: http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/#features

Look at the tables for what is supported at each compliance level:
http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/compliance/

Take a look at the features supported at each level as indicated by its URI by clicking on it:

| Level | URI                                    |
|:------|:---------------------------------------|
| 0     | http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level0.json |
| 1     | http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level1.json |
| 2     | http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json |

<div class="alert">Do you understand how the profile level relates to the compliance tables?</div>
