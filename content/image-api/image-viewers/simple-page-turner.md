While we'll cover more full-featured viewers when we get to the Presentation API, it is possible though to create a rudimentary page turner with image viewers like Leaflet and OpenSeadragon.

1. You can see a [simple example of OpenSeadragon as a page turner][osd tilesource].

2. Make your browser _very_ narrow on your screen and then open [this example of a simple page turner in Leaflet][leaflet pageturner].
<!-- #backlog:660 once the NCSU Libraries example no longer uses Leaflet use a different example -->

## Questions
